= YamlDb

YamlDb is a command line utility and a Rails plugin to dump and restore data from apps using ActiveRecord. For Rails apps, it add rake tasks that complements the the database-independent schema format found in db/schema.rb.  The data is saved into db/data.yml.

This can be used as a replacement for mysqldump or pg_dump, but only for the databases typically used by AR apps. Users, permissions, schemas, triggers, and other advanced database features are not supported - by design.

Any database that has an ActiveRecord adapter should work.

== Usage

=== Command Line
yamldb [optional app path] dump [path. if omitted will dump to STDOUT]
yamldb [optional app path] load [path]

=== Rails
rake db:data:dump   ->   Dump contents of Rails database to db/data.yml
rake db:data:load   ->   Load contents of db/data.yml into the database

Further, there are tasks db:dump and db:load which do the entire database (the equivalent of running db:schema:dump followed by db:data:load).

== Examples

One common use would be to switch your data from one database backend to another.  For example, let's say you wanted to switch from SQLite to MySQL.  You might execute the following steps:

1. yamldb dump myapp.yml

2. Edit database.yml and change your adapter to mysql, set up database params

3. mysqladmin create [database name]

4. yamldb load myapp.yml
